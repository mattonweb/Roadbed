# Roadbed.Logging Reference

A self-contained library that persists structured `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`
output to a relational database and tracks the **activities** (run instances of
jobs, pipelines, ad-hoc work) that those log rows tie back to. OpenTelemetry-
first: MEL flows through the OTel logging pipeline, and database persistence is
one exporter — adding OTLP export (Grafana / Tempo / Jaeger / etc.) later is a
configuration add, not a rewrite.

Activity rows are mutable; log entries are append-only and flushed off the
hot path by a bounded channel + background writer. The library has **no
dependency on `Roadbed.Crud`** — its bulk-insert path is internal, custom, and
stamps each row with its own originating `activity_id` rather than a uniform
activity id like the CRUDALBT "B" tier.

| Wiring                      | `InstallLogging` (`IServiceCollectionInstaller`), `LoggingBuilderExtensions.AddRoadbedDbLogging`        |

## MUST

- **MUST** register a singleton `LoggingOptions` and a singleton `ILoggingDatabaseFactory` in DI **before** calling `services.InstallModulesInAppDomain(configuration)`. The installer resolves both up-front and throws if either is missing.
- **MUST** call `builder.Logging.AddRoadbedDbLogging()` on the host's `ILoggingBuilder` to wire the OpenTelemetry MEL provider, the batch processor, and the database exporter. The `IServiceCollectionInstaller` does **not** see `ILoggingBuilder`, so this step lives outside `InstallLogging`.
- **MUST** generate the activity ULID in the consuming application — Roadbed.Logging does **not** generate identifiers. Pass the same ULID you used for `IAsyncBulkInsertOperation.BulkInsertAsync` calls during the run.
- **MUST** set `LoggingOptions.Application` (and ideally `Environment`) so every row carries identifying provenance. The exporter stamps these onto every `LoggingLogEntry`.
- **MUST** set `LoggingOptions.Schema` to the MySQL database name (e.g. `"ops"`, `"platform"`) in production. The default is the empty string for SQLite-dev friendliness.
- **MUST** install the three table DDL scripts (`activity`, `activity_input`, `log_entries`) against the target schema **before** the host starts. Roadbed.Logging does not run schema migrations.
- **MUST** schedule a monthly partition-maintenance job in MySQL that (a) pre-creates next month's partition and (b) drops partitions whose range falls outside the 90-day retention window. On SQLite, run `DELETE FROM log_entries WHERE event_time_utc < datetime('now', '-90 days');` on the same cadence.
- **MUST** call `service.CompleteAsync(...)` or `service.FailAsync(...)` explicitly when a run ends. Disposing the `LoggingActivityScope` pops the ambient MEL scope and stops the diagnostic Activity, but it does **not** record a terminal status.
- **MUST** use structured log templates (`logger.LogInformation("Loaded {RowCount}", count)`) — the exporter splits the template (stored as `message_template`) from the named args (stored as `properties` JSON) for downstream aggregation. Interpolated `$"..."` strings produce a single rendered message with no template.

## MUST NOT

- **MUST NOT** reference `Roadbed.Crud` from a project that already takes `Roadbed.Logging`. The library is deliberately a peer, not a consumer, of the CRUD pattern.
- **MUST NOT** point `ILoggingDatabaseFactory` at any `DataConnectionStringType` other than `MySQL`, `SQLite`, or `SQLiteInMemory`. The installer throws on every other value.
- **MUST NOT** rely on `LoggingActivityScope` to auto-finalize the activity row. Skipped, Canceled, and Succeeded outcomes are all distinct terminal states; the dispose path has no way to choose between them.
- **MUST NOT** invent your own batching or retry layer around `LoggingActivityService` or the log-entry path — the background writer already batches, falls back to `Console.Error` on database error, and flushes on `StopAsync`.
- **MUST NOT** log from a category that overlaps `LoggingOptions.RecursionGuardCategories` and expect the entry to be persisted. Categories under `Roadbed.Logging`, `Roadbed.Data`, `Roadbed.Data.MySql`, `Roadbed.Data.Sqlite`, and `MySqlConnector` are dropped to prevent the database write path from logging through itself.
- **MUST NOT** pass `LoggingActivityStatus.Failed` to `CompleteAsync`. Use `FailAsync(activityId, exception)` instead — it records the exception message and type as well as the terminal status.
- **MUST NOT** read `IConfiguration` from inside Roadbed.Logging-aware code expecting the library to honor it. The library only sees `LoggingOptions` and `ILoggingDatabaseFactory` from DI.
- **MUST NOT** re-register `LoggingChannel` in DI. `InstallLogging` registers it as a process-wide shared instance built from `LoggingOptions`; the host writer (in the host container) and every producer-side OTel exporter (in any container — host, `ServiceLocator` snapshot, or test fixture) all need to resolve the **same** object. Overwriting that registration in `Program.cs` (e.g. via `services.AddSingleton<LoggingChannel>(new LoggingChannel(...))`) is what creates the "`activity` rows write but `log_entries` stays empty" symptom.

## Consuming-application host wiring

The canonical startup recipe — register `LoggingOptions` and `ILoggingDatabaseFactory` **before** anything else logging-related, call `AddRoadbedDbLogging()` on the logging builder, then run `InstallModulesInAppDomain`. The order shown below is the one the framework is tested against:

```csharp
// Program.cs (host)
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Roadbed;
using Roadbed.Logging;

var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

// 1. The two POCO singletons the framework reads at install time.
builder.Services.AddSingleton(new LoggingOptions
{
    Schema      = "logging",                                     // MySQL DB name; empty for SQLite-dev
    Application = "Foo",
    Environment = builder.Environment.EnvironmentName,
    BatchSize   = 1000,
    FlushInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
});

builder.Services.AddSingleton<ILoggingDatabaseFactory, FooLoggingDatabaseFactory>();

// 2. Wire the OpenTelemetry MEL provider, batch processor, and DB exporter
//    onto the host's logging builder. Safe to call before InstallModules*
//    — the exporter resolves LoggingChannel lazily on first export, not at
//    OTel-provider realization, so installer-discovery order is not load-
//    bearing.
builder.Logging.AddRoadbedDbLogging();

// 3. Discover and run every IServiceCollectionInstaller, including
//    InstallExtensionsLogging (Roadbed.Common) and InstallLogging
//    (Roadbed.Logging). InstallLogging eagerly constructs the shared
//    LoggingChannel instance and registers it as a singleton.
builder.Services.InstallModulesInAppDomain(builder.Configuration);

using var host = builder.Build();
await host.RunAsync();
```

### Supported providers

Set `ILoggingDatabaseFactory.Connecion.ConnectionStringType` to one of:

| Type                                                        | Use                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DataConnectionStringType.MySQL`                            | Production. `log_entries` ships with monthly RANGE partitioning for fast retention drops.        |
| `DataConnectionStringType.SQLite`                           | Local/dev only. No partitioning; retention is a scheduled `DELETE` job.                          |
| `DataConnectionStringType.SQLiteInMemory`                   | Test harness only. Same as SQLite but the database vanishes when the connection closes.          |

`Postgres`, `Unknown`, and any other value cause `InstallLogging` to throw `InvalidOperationException` at install time.

### Database setup (MySQL example)

Apply the install script under `src/Roadbed.Logging/Assets/Tables/<table>/install_mysql.txt` (or paste the consolidated copies further down this reference) against your target database. The default DDL uses `{SchemaPrefix}` as a placeholder; substitute `logging.` (or your chosen schema name) before executing.

The DB user the app runs as needs `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `SELECT` privileges on all three tables — `activity` rows writing successfully only proves the activity path's grants exist; `log_entries` can fail silently if the same user lacks INSERT there.

### Why the shared channel matters

Roadbed framework services use the dual-constructor pattern: their public constructor resolves dependencies via `ServiceLocator.GetService<T>()`, and `ServiceLocator` holds a point-in-time **snapshot** of the host's `IServiceCollection` — a separate `IServiceProvider` from the host's own container. When a `ServiceLocator`-resolved component logs, the log record flows through *that snapshot's* OTel logger provider, which builds *its own* `RoadbedDbLogRecordExporter`. The exporter resolves `LoggingChannel` from the snapshot's provider, not the host's.

`InstallLogging` registers `LoggingChannel` as `AddSingleton<LoggingChannel>(eagerInstance)` — a **concrete-instance descriptor** rather than a typed factory — so every `IServiceProvider` built from the underlying collection returns the same object. Producers in any container converge on one channel; the `LogWriterHostedService` running in the host container drains that one channel.

## Troubleshooting

**`activity` rows write but `log_entries` stays empty (no `Console.Error` fallback firing either).** The exporter is enqueueing into a `LoggingChannel` that the host writer does not drain. After the framework fix that ships `LoggingChannel` as a shared singleton, the usual causes are:

1. Something in `Program.cs` (or another installer) re-registered `LoggingChannel` after `InstallLogging` ran, replacing the shared instance.
2. The host code is using an older vendored copy of `Roadbed.Common.dll` or `Roadbed.Logging.dll` that still freezes a throwaway `ILoggerFactory` (the pre-fix behavior). Re-vendor both DLLs from the framework solution's `bin/Release/net10.0/` directory.
3. The DB user has `INSERT` on `logging.activity` but not on `logging.log_entries`. The `activity` write proves only that grant; check `SHOW GRANTS FOR <user>` for the full set.

**Startup crash: `No service for type 'Roadbed.Logging.LoggingChannel' has been registered.`** This was the symptom when `AddRoadbedDbLogging()` was called before `InstallModulesInAppDomain` AND `InstallExtensionsLogging` eagerly realized the OTel provider via a throwaway service provider. After the framework fix, the exporter resolves `LoggingChannel` lazily on first export — never at OTel-provider realization — so this crash should not occur even with the documented startup order. If you do see it, you are on a pre-fix vendored DLL.

**Log lines from `ServiceLocator`-resolved components are missing while host-resolved ones land fine.** This is the cause-2 symptom from the pre-fix design. Confirm both `Roadbed.Common.dll` and `Roadbed.Logging.dll` are at or after the fix version; the channel-sharing test in `Roadbed.Test.Unit.Logging.InstallLoggingTests` covers exactly this scenario.

## Code patterns

### Host wire-up (abbreviated)

```csharp
// See the Consuming-application host wiring section above for the full
// recipe with comments. The compact form:
var builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddSingleton(new LoggingOptions
{
    Schema = "logging",
    Application = "Foo",
    Environment = builder.Environment.EnvironmentName,
});

builder.Services.AddSingleton<ILoggingDatabaseFactory, FooLoggingDatabaseFactory>();

builder.Logging.AddRoadbedDbLogging();   // OTel + batch processor + exporter

builder.Services.InstallModulesInAppDomain(builder.Configuration);  // InstallLogging runs here

using var host = builder.Build();
await host.RunAsync();
```

### Marker-interface factory implementation

```csharp
namespace Foo.App;

using System;
using System.Data;
using Microsoft.Data.Sqlite;
using Roadbed.Data;
using Roadbed.Logging;

internal sealed class FooLoggingDatabaseFactory : ILoggingDatabaseFactory
{
    public FooLoggingDatabaseFactory(IConnectionStringProvider provider)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(provider);

        this.Connecion = new DataConnecionString(
            DataConnectionStringType.MySQL,
            provider.Resolve("FooLogging"));
    }

    public DataConnecionString Connecion { get; }

    public IDbConnection CreateOpenConnection() { /* open + return */ throw new NotImplementedException(); }

    public Task<IDbConnection> CreateOpenConnectionAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        /* open + return */ throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

### A Quartz job that opens an activity

```csharp
namespace Foo.App.Jobs;

using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Quartz;
using Roadbed.Logging;
using Roadbed.Scheduling;

public sealed class FooIngestionJob : BaseSchedulingJob<FooIngestionJob>
{
    private readonly LoggingActivityService _activities;
    private readonly IFooLoader _loader;

    public FooIngestionJob(
        ILogger<FooIngestionJob> logger,
        LoggingActivityService activities,
        IFooLoader loader)
        : base(
            name: "FooIngestion",
            description: "Loads the Foo dataset every 15 minutes.",
            schedule: new SchedulingSchedule(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15)),
            logger: logger)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(activities);
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(loader);

        this._activities = activities;
        this._loader = loader;
    }

    public override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        string activityId = Ulid.NewUlid().ToString();        // app owns the ULID dep

        using LoggingActivityScope scope = await this._activities.BeginAsync(
            new LoggingActivityBeginRequest
            {
                Id = activityId,
                ActivityType = LoggingActivityType.Ingestion.ToString().ToLowerInvariant(),
                Target = "ops.foo",
                ActivityKey = "Foo.Ingestion.FullRefresh",
                FireInstanceId = this.Context.FireInstanceId,
                QuartzJobName = this.Context.JobDetail.Key.Name,
                QuartzJobGroup = this.Context.JobDetail.Key.Group,
                QuartzTriggerName = this.Context.Trigger.Key.Name,
                QuartzTriggerGroup = this.Context.Trigger.Key.Group,
                SchedulerInstanceId = this.Context.Scheduler.SchedulerInstanceId,
            },
            cancellationToken);

        try
        {
            int rows = await this._loader.LoadAsync(activityId, cancellationToken);

            await this._activities.CompleteAsync(
                activityId,
                LoggingActivityStatus.Succeeded,
                recordsImpacted: rows,
                cancellationToken: cancellationToken);

            this.Context.Result = $"Loaded {rows:N0} foo rows";
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            await this._activities.FailAsync(activityId, ex, CancellationToken.None);
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

### Heartbeating from a long-running step

```csharp
while (await reader.ReadBatchAsync(cancellationToken) is { } batch)
{
    await this._sink.WriteAsync(batch, cancellationToken);
    await this._activities.HeartbeatAsync(activityId, cancellationToken);
}
```

### Patching current state mid-run

```csharp
await this._activities.UpdateAsync(
    new LoggingActivityUpdateRequest
    {
        ActivityId = activityId,
        Target = $"ops.{table}",                // discovered after Begin
        ParametersJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(currentParameters),
        RecordsImpacted = runningTotal,
    },
    cancellationToken);
```

### Recording lineage edges

```csharp
// "this silver-run consumed those two bronze loads"
await this._activities.AddInputAsync(silverActivityId, bronzePlacesActivityId, inputRole: "places", cancellationToken);
await this._activities.AddInputAsync(silverActivityId, bronzeCousubsActivityId, inputRole: "cousubs", cancellationToken);
```

## Common pitfalls

❌ Disposing the scope without calling `CompleteAsync`:
```csharp
using var scope = await activities.BeginAsync(request, ct);
await DoWorkAsync(ct);
// scope disposes → row stays in 'running' forever
```
✅ Always finalize explicitly:
```csharp
using var scope = await activities.BeginAsync(request, ct);
try { await DoWorkAsync(ct); await activities.CompleteAsync(scope.ActivityId, LoggingActivityStatus.Succeeded, cancellationToken: ct); }
catch (Exception ex) { await activities.FailAsync(scope.ActivityId, ex, CancellationToken.None); throw; }
```

❌ Logging from inside the database write path:
```csharp
// Repository inside Roadbed.Logging itself
this._logger.LogInformation("Inserted {N} entries", count);
// → category is "Roadbed.Logging.Repositories.LoggingLogEntryRepository"
// → recursion-guarded → silently dropped
```
✅ Either accept the drop (the guard exists for a reason) or pick a category outside the guard list for genuine operator-visible diagnostics.

❌ Treating logs as a substitute for the activity row:
```csharp
this._logger.LogInformation("Starting Foo run with batch={BatchId}", batchId);
// no activity row → no run record, no heartbeat, no terminal status
```
✅ Open an activity at run start; logs become the per-event narrative attached to it.

❌ Setting `Schema = "ops"` against SQLite without ATTACH:
```csharp
new LoggingOptions { Schema = "ops" }
// SQL becomes "INSERT INTO ops.activity ..." which SQLite rejects.
```
✅ Either leave `Schema` empty for SQLite or ATTACH the file under that alias.

❌ Passing `LoggingActivityStatus.Failed` to `CompleteAsync`:
```csharp
await activities.CompleteAsync(id, LoggingActivityStatus.Failed);  // throws ArgumentException
```
✅ Use `FailAsync(id, exception)` — it records the message and type as well.

## DDL install scripts

These are copies of the source-of-truth files in
`src/Roadbed.Logging/Assets/Tables/<table>/install_<provider>.txt`. Before
executing, substitute the literal token `{SchemaPrefix}` with either the
empty string (unqualified) or a database name followed by a dot (`ops.`).

### Retention

- **MySQL** — schedule a monthly job that pre-creates next month's partition and drops every partition whose range is older than the retention window. Roadbed.Logging does not ship the partition routine; build it as a stored proc or a Roadbed.Scheduling job.
- **SQLite** — schedule the same cadence to run:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM {SchemaPrefix}log_entries
  WHERE event_time_utc < datetime('now', '-90 days');
  ```
  Follow with `VACUUM` (or set `PRAGMA auto_vacuum = INCREMENTAL` plus periodic `incremental_vacuum`) to reclaim disk.
